# gridfinity_paramaterized
Gridfinity basic building blocks, fully parameterized to support any grid size.

Uses grid specifications from [Zack Freedman](https://youtu.be/ra_9zU-mnl8), except this allows the grid size to be altered. Zack's move to make this open source is great, but I personally didn't care for the 42 mm grid size, prefering [Alexandre Chappel]() 55 mm size. And Zack's project broke when using a different grid size. I also spent a fair bit of time cleaning the components up and parameterizing it.
